# Introduction

The viva is incredibly stressful for the Vivee. Although we mostly know everything will be ok, until the viva is over *they* will not feel that way! Taking some of the stress away is helpful. So try to take most of the organisation away (unless tehy are a natural organiser and this is how they relax!)


# Beforehand:

- Is a room booked?

- Is anyone joining online?
	Does Teams/Zoom work
	Does microphone work
	Does camera work

- What time will tea be?

- Who is bringing tea?

- Do they want a meal after?
	- Is it booked?
	- How many?
	- Where?


# Items for room:

- Sign for door ('Viva in progress')
- Water and glasses/cups for everyone
- Tissues (j/k kinda)


# Post-viva celebrations
