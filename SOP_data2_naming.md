# Aim
The aim of this SOP is to ensure consistency in code and filename readability. The follwoing principles will be applied:


1. The variable name must describe the information represented by the variable. A variable name should tell you specifically in words what the variable stands for.
2. Your code will be read more times than it is written. Prioritize how easy your code is to understand rather than how quickly it is written.
3. Adopt standard conventions for naming so you can make one global decision instead of multiple local decisions.
