The tidier your submission is, the higher your chance of having it accepted!

### First submission and resubmission

- [ ] Are all tables/figures (including supplementary!) referenced in the text?
- [ ] Does the order of figures, tables, supplementary tables follow the order they're mentioned in the text?
- [ ] Are the tables in your Supplementary Tables file in the right order, i.e., does Table S2 still follow Table S1?
- [ ] If you have any paper-wide set orders of things (like species B, species C, species D), are they consistent in the text, tables, figures?
- [ ] Are all special words consistently spelled? for example, does the text switch from 'AA-genome' to 'A-genome', or from 'A-genome' to 'A genome'?

- [ ] Are your figures color-blind friendly? Check with tools like http://mapeper.github.io/jsColorblindSimulator/ (thanks @Psy_Fer_, @AgnieszkaGolicz, @_erikaroper!)
- [ ] Is there any leftover placeholder text like (CITATION), doi://XYZ, Table X, [TODO]? 
- [ ] Have you forgotten a co-author?
- [ ] Is everyone's **name** spelled as in their other papers? 
    - [ ] What about their affiliations?
    - [ ] Orcid IDs
- [ ] Reread the journal's formatting rules - are you really following them? Are you sure about the order of your sections, and that you have all required sections?
- [ ] Are your references in the right format? Do you have in-text references not in your References block? Are species names in italics? 
- [ ] Do you have duplicated references? (You can have Person 2016a and Person 2016b, but they're just two slightly differently spelled entries in your library)
- [ ] Are species names in your text/figures/tables in italics?
- [ ] Is your data deposited in the required repositories (SRA, Zenodo etc.), and is the link in the manuscript? (thanks @sarvenaz_s!)

- [ ] Have you uploaded all files the text references, including the coverletter?
- [ ] Have you clicked the submit button?
- [ ] Have you been kind to yourself and others?

## Wait for your answer

### Desk rejection

Happens to the best of us. Don't take it personally. The best response is often to move on. 

Sometimes, you can appeal this, but this is something you will have to discuss in depth with Kenny.

## Reviews

Keep. Calm.

Give yourself a night to sleep on reviews before taking any steps.

Read through them a number of times, formulate a plan and then contact your co-authors.



### Resubmission
- [ ] When resubmitting, have all co-authors had enough time to comment on the revised manuscript? Should you follow up with co-authors who haven't sent anything?
- [ ] Reread the reviewers' comments in the original email/file - have you missed any in your response?
- [ ] If your co-authors have sent you their suggestions in separate files, have you included them all? Easy to miss one when you have 20 almost-identical Word files! Check your inbox, too!
- [ ] Have any tables/figures/supplementary table numbers changed, and are these correctly referenced in the text? Is (Table 2) in the text still (Table 2), or should it be (Table 4) now?
- [ ] If you were the reviewer, would you feel like your concerns were sufficiently addressed?
