# Preparing a manuscript for publication

## Writing the paper

This document assumes you have a paper written that your PI and imediate co-authors are happy with and you're ready to submit. 


### Sample email to ALL co-authors before submission

Dear X
Attached is the final draft of manuscript "[TITLE]". Thank you all for your excellent contribution to this work. 

We plan to submit to [JOURNAL] by [DATE] and we would appreciate your revisions and comments before this date so we may incorporate them.

If we don't hear from you, we will assume you are OK with the submission of this manuscript.

Thanks again,

Yours,

### Choosing a journal

- [ ] Field specific?
- [ ] Is imapct factor important?



### The coverletter
- [ ] Is the paper-title in the coverletter still the same as in the manuscript?
- [ ] Is it on Roslin/PSH headed paper?
- [ ] Is it signed by *all* corresponding authors?

### First submission and resubmission

The tidier your submission is, the higher your chance of having it accepted! The list below was altered from https://github.com/philippbayer/

- [ ] Have you been kind to yourself and others?  
- [ ] Are all tables/figures (including supplementary!) referenced in the text?
- [ ] Does the order of figures, tables, supplementary tables follow the order they're mentioned in the text?
- [ ] Are the tables in your Supplementary Tables file in the right order, i.e., does Table S2 still follow Table S1?
- [ ] Are your figures color-blind friendly? Check with tools like http://mapeper.github.io/jsColorblindSimulator/ (thanks @Psy_Fer_, @AgnieszkaGolicz, @_erikaroper!)
- [ ] Is your coloring scheme consistent across figures, where applicable?
- [ ] Are the supplementary tables/figures pretty enough, numbers correctly formatted, table headers detailed enough?  
~.
- [ ] If you have any paper-wide set orders of things (like species B, species C, species D), are they consistent in the text, tables, figures?
- [ ] Is there any leftover placeholder text like (CITATION), doi://XYZ, Table X, [TODO]? 
- [ ] Are species names in your text/figures/tables in italics?
- [ ] Are all special words consistently spelled? for example, does the text switch from 'AA-genome' to 'A-genome', or from 'A-genome' to 'A genome'?  
~. 
- [ ] **Do you need to inform any collaborators or organisations prior to submission or publication?**
- [ ] Have you forgotten a co-author?
- [ ] Is everyone's **name** spelled as in their other papers? 
    - [ ] What about their affiliations?
    - [ ] Orcid IDs. 
~. 
- [ ] Reread the journal's formatting rules - are you really following them? 
- [ ] Are you sure about the order of your sections, and that you have all required sections?
- [ ] Are your references in the right format? 
- [ ] Do you have in-text references not in your References block? 
- [ ] Do you have duplicated references? (You can have Person 2016a and Person 2016b, but they're just two slightly differently spelled entries in your library). 
~. 
- [ ] Is your data deposited in the required repositories (SRA, Zenodo etc.), and is the link in the manuscript 
  
For conda env (thanks Bo!!).  
  
Export environment: conda env export > environmentpy.yml. 
Create environment using the file: conda env create -f environment.yml. 
Which can be used for publishing code with packages requirement. 


- [ ] In the acknowledgments, are all grants acknowledged with correct IDs? Are students' scholarships acknowledged? Are your institutions (HPC!) acknowledged?  
~. 
- [ ] Have you run the spellchecker manually one last time?
- [ ] Have you uploaded all files the text references, including the coverletter?
- [ ] Have you clicked the submit button?
- [ ] Check again: Have you been kind to yourself and others? 
  
## Wait for your answer
  
### Desk rejection
  
Happens to the best of us. Don't take it personally. The best response is often to move on. 
  
Sometimes, you can appeal this, but this is something you will have to discuss in depth with Kenny.
  
## Reviews
  
Keep. Calm.

The person who has reviewed your paper is just that. A person. They may be right and they may be wrong. Try to think critically about the feedback. 
  
Give yourself a night to sleep on reviews before taking any steps.
  
Read through them a number of times, formulate a plan and then contact your co-authors.

Do you have a deadline for the resubmission?

### Addressing Comments

Brief rules:
- Be polite. Be nice. You may not agree with the reviewers but you don't need to be mean about it.
- Make everything easy for the editor/reviewer.
- If it is your first time, please ask more experienced lab members for some examples.
- If you change figures, don't make the reviewers go searching.

Create two new files:

- File1 : Copy/Paste all the reviewer comments and after each individual comment write a short response to that comment. For example

`
Reviewer2: I think you don't know how to add 2+2.
Answer: We thank Reviewer 2 for this insightful comment. Please see a basic mathematics text for the interpretation of 2+2 which we beleive is in agreement with the conclusions made in our manuscript.
`

- File2: A copy of the manuscript with all changes tracked (and line numbers referenced in File1). 



### Resubmission
- [ ] When resubmitting, have all co-authors had enough time to comment on the revised manuscript? Should you follow up with co-authors who haven't sent anything?
- [ ] Reread the reviewers' comments in the original email/file - have you missed any in your response?
- [ ] If your co-authors have sent you their suggestions in separate files, have you included them all? Easy to miss one when you have 20 almost-identical Word files! Check your inbox, too!
- [ ] Have any tables/figures/supplementary table numbers changed, and are these correctly referenced in the text? Is (Table 2) in the text still (Table 2), or should it be (Table 4) now?
- [ ] If you were the reviewer, would you feel like your concerns were sufficiently addressed?
